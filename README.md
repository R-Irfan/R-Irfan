## Hi! I'm Irfan.

an XR Developer at Rebel Goods with a wealth of experience and a passion for pushing the boundaries of immersive technology. As a former XROS fellow, selected from a pool of 10,000 applicants and sponsored by Meta and FICCI, I played a pivotal role in the development of the Sneakerland App. My focus on the Avatar Customization System and AR Try-On features resulted in a project that I proudly open-sourced. Beyond my professional endeavors, I've ventured into freelance projects, showcasing my versatility in Product and Architectural visualization. With a keen interest in smartphone-based 6DoF XR Solutions, I'm actively researching and developing innovative techniques, from hand tracking interactions to using a PC mouse as a 6DoF Controller.



My XR journey began during my Btech studies, inspired by sci-fi books and iconic VR headsets like Oculus Rift, Vive, and Cardboard. This passion led to the creation of a simple DIY MR headset prototype. Along the way, I've garnered recognition in hackathons and game jams, winning awards for projects like "Human Anatomy - Immersive Learning Experience" and "PowAR Game." My commitment extends to contributing to XR communities such as Manomotion and Lightship ARDK, where I actively share insights and learnings.
