## Hi! I'm Irfan.

#### I'm an *XR Developer*, working at Rebel Goods. I have intermediate experience in Unity3d, ARFoundation, XR Interaction toolkit, and other XR SDKs. In my free time, I am researching and developing a smartphone-based 6DoF XR Solutions, with various input methods like Hand tracking interactions, support for generic Bluetooth controllers, using the normal PC mouse as a 6DoF Controller, Secondary smartphone as controller 3DoF(using Gyro sensor) and 6DoF (using ARCore positional tracking), Hand tracking interactions, etc., I am planning to open source some of the techniques I developed, once I integrate it with the XR Interaction toolkit and MRTK. .
